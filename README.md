# Digital-Signature
The program that serves to make digital signature. In the repository are source code and executable file (Digil taSignature\dist\digital_signature/digital_signature.exe). 
The program use my own implementation true random generator. In the "Files\random_source" I prepared correct source file to this generator, but it is possible use your own image (8 bit, gray).
